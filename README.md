# 🏅 Olympics Data Analytics & Machine Learning (Python)

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **visualization**, and a **Predictive Model** on the Olympics dataset using **Python in Jupyter Notebook**.  
The goal is to uncover patterns in Olympic history and build a machine learning model using **Logistic Regression**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Dataset**: Olympics historical dataset (athletes, sports, medals, countries, etc.)  
- **Tools**: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Key Focus**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Handling missing values  
  - Analyzing medal counts by country and year  
  - Participation trends (nations, athletes, gender distribution)  
  - Most popular sports and events  
  - Building a **Logistic Regression model** for prediction  
  - Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
